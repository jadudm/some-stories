18F is required to earn ${{site.data.constants.fixed}}M every year.

This story is not about why that is true. It simply *is*.

18F bills staff out at a rate of ${{site.data.constants.hourly | times: 1000000 | fmt: "0d" }}/hour. 

How many hours do we need to bill in order to make ${{site.data.constants.fixed}}M?
