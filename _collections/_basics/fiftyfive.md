For the moment, let's work with the assumption that we need <b>55 staff</b> billing <br><b>48 weeks/year</b> at <b>32 hours/week</b> in order to dig out of the ${{ site.data.constants.fixed }}M overhead.

This is a *tidy* assumption.

But, there is complexity waiting in the wings.

1. Management
3. Hiring
4. Staffing
5. Business Development

I'm going to take the set of assumptions laid out here (55 staff, 48 weeks, 32 hours/week), and see how the picture changes with each of these new twists.

Then, after exploring these three challenges, I'll bring them all together in one model.

So. [Bring forth the cat wranglers!]({{ site.baseurl }}/meow/)
