Many of our hires are 2/2s, meaning a two-year term potentially renewable for an additional two years. 

Practically, **a 2/2 hire lasts anywhere from 1-3 years**. Because finding another job takes time, and cannot always be timed neatly, we tend to lose staff before they spend a full four years at 18F.

<span style="color: red;">**18F sees a {{ site.data.constants.turnover | times: 100 | to_integer }}% turnover in staff every year**</span>.

If we need **55 staff** to dig out of the ${{ site.data.constants.fixed }}M hole, we need to be hiring **15 people every year** just to maintain billable staff. 

If we need **63 staff** (to carry management), that means we would need to be hiring **18 people every year** just to maintain numbers. That, and we're potentially going to be rotating people out of billable roles into management roles, so we'll probably need to hire 2-3 more/year to backfill.

**Hiring is bad**.
