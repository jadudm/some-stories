# Two Stories

One is a story for people who do the things.

Another is if you want to turn knobs.

All people can, of course, read all stories.

## About The Stories

The stories are meant to be interacted with. 

In all cases, the stories start with simple assumptions and approximations, and then slowly, those assumptions are peeled back, and the approximations made more complex and realistic. 

None of the stories should be mistaken for reality.
